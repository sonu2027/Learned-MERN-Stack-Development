3. Color Mixer
Write a JavaScript program that takes in two strings representing colors and uses a switch statement to determine the resulting color when the two colors are mixed. The program should print the resulting color based on the following criteria:

--> If color1 is "red" and color2 is "blue" or vice versa, print "purple"
--> If color1 is "red" and color2 is "yellow" or vice versa, print "orange"
--> If color1 is "blue" and "color2" is "yellow" or vice versa, print "green"
--> If any other combination of colors is input, the program should print "Invalid color combination"
