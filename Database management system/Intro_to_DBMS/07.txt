7. Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advantages.

Ans. 
I)External Schema (User View):
The external schema represents the way individual users or groups of users perceive and interact with the data. It defines specific subsets of data and the corresponding operations that are relevant to a particular user or application.
Advantages:
Data Independence: Changes made to the conceptual or internal schema do not affect the external schema. This allows modifications to be made to the underlying data structure without impacting user applications.
Customization: Different users or applications can have tailored views of the data, providing a personalized and intuitive interface.
Security and Privacy: Access controls can be enforced at the external schema level, ensuring that users only have access to the data they are authorized to view and manipulate.

II) Conceptual Schema (Logical View):
The conceptual schema represents the overall logical view of the entire database. It defines the relationships between data elements, entities, attributes, and constraints without considering the physical storage details.
Advantages:
Data Independence: Changes made to the internal schema do not affect the conceptual schema. This separation enables modifications to the physical storage and access methods without affecting the logical structure.
Database Design: The conceptual schema serves as a high-level blueprint for designing the database, guiding the creation of tables, relationships, and constraints.
Query Optimization: Query optimization can be performed based on the logical organization of data, improving overall system performance.

III) Internal Schema (Physical View):
The internal schema represents the physical storage and access methods used by the database management system. It defines how data is stored on the underlying hardware, including file structures, indexing, and storage optimization techniques.
Advantages:
Data Independence: Changes made to the internal schema, such as altering storage structures or indexes, do not impact the external or conceptual schemas. This ensures that modifications at the physical level do not affect user applications.
Performance Optimization: The internal schema allows database administrators to optimize storage, indexing, and retrieval mechanisms to achieve efficient data access and processing.
Security and Integrity: Security mechanisms, such as encryption and access controls, can be implemented at the internal schema level to protect data stored on the physical storage devices.
