Q4. Explain the different types of Keys in RDBMS considering a real-life scenario.

Ans. 
Real life scenario: Online Bookstore Database
Imagine you are designing a database for an online bookstore. The database needs to store information about books, authors, customers, and orders. Here are the different types of keys in the context of this scenario:

1. Primary Key (PK):
   - Definition: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record (row) in a table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and provides a reference point for other tables to establish relationships.
   - Example: In the "Books" table, the primary key could be "BookID," a unique identifier assigned to each book.

2. Foreign Key (FK):
   - Definition: A foreign key is a reference to a primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between tables, linking data in one table to data in another.
   - Example: In the "Orders" table, there could be a foreign key "CustomerID" that references the primary key "CustomerID" in the "Customers" table. This indicates which customer placed the order.

3. Candidate Key:
   - Definition: A candidate key is a set of one or more attributes that could serve as a primary key. It uniquely identifies records within a table.
   - Example: In the "Authors" table, both "AuthorID" and "Email" could be candidate keys since they uniquely identify authors.

4. Super Key:
   - Definition: A super key is a set of one or more attributes that uniquely identify records in a table. It may contain more attributes than the minimum required for a primary key.
   - Example: A super key for the "Books" table could be the combination of "ISBN" (International Standard Book Number) and "Edition." While this uniquely identifies books, it contains more information than just the primary key "BookID."

5. Composite Key:
   - Definition: A composite key is a primary key that consists of two or more attributes. It is used when a single attribute does not uniquely identify records, but the combination of attributes does.
   - Example: In the "OrderDetails" table, a composite key could be "OrderID" and "BookID," ensuring that each row represents a specific book within a particular order.

6. Alternate Key:
   - Definition: An alternate key is a candidate key that is not selected as the primary key. It serves as an alternative option for uniquely identifying records.
   - Example: In the "Customers" table, "Email" could be an alternate key if "CustomerID" is chosen as the primary key.
